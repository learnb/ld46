## Play

You can [play it](https://blearn.itch.io/adventure-watch) on itch.io.

## Description

Adventure Watch is a small game inspired by Tamagotchi gameplay but with a twist. Instead of a pet, you must keep an adventurer alive while she fights monsters and collects loot.

The adventurer performs actions herself. As she adventures she will gain gold, which the player can use. However performing actions deplete her resources: HP and hunger. If either resource is completely depleted the adventurer will die â˜ .

You can replenish her resources by spending gold to play a timed mini-game. You replenish more resources the better you perform in the mini-game.
